# Calculator of angular spectra of arbitrary electromagnetic multipole sources:

This applet allows users to compute and display directly the angular spectrum representation of any electromagnetic multipole field. It is designed to be flexible and easy to use, with a layout wrapping two different workspaces. First tab enables the first multipolar orders, i.e., electric dipole (ED), magnetic dipole (MD), and electric quadrupole (EQ), and any linear combination of these. The second one addresses the electric- and magnetic-like Hertz potentials of any arbitrary order {l,m} and their corresponding electromagnetic multipole fields.
